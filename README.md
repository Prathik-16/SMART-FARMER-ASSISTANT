In recent years, due to uncertain climatic variations, natural calamities, and other issues, crop prices have varied to a larger extent. Farmers are uninformed of these uncertainties, which causes massive loss. The developed Crop Price Forecasting System is a well-designed system that provides results in predicting the price and yield of the crop.  Agriculture planning plays a significant role in the economic growth and food security of the agro-based country. Price prediction depends on various parameters such as seed rate, market price, and government policies. Many researchers studied the prediction of crop yield, prediction of weather, soil classification, and crop classification for agriculture planning using statistical methods or machine learning techniques. The proposed method may improve the net yield rate of crops.
